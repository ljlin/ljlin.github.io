I am a third-year MSc student in CS at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Saarland University. [\[CV\]](/files/CV_Jianlin_Li.pdf)

Research interests
======
I am generally interested in theorem proving and code-level verification of real-world software and theorem proving, such as certified system software, concurrent separation logic, and Coq.

Education
======
* Master in Computer Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2021 (expected)
* Master in Computer Science, Saarland University, 2021 (expected)
* Bachelor of Computer Science, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 2018
