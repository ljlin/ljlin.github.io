Old Homepage
=====

I am a Ph.D student at [PLG](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/), University of Waterloo (started from Fall 2021). I am co-supervised by [Ondřej Lhoták](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~olhotak/) and [Yizhou Zhang](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~yizhou/). 

Research interests
======
I am generally interested in theorem proving and code-level verification of real-world software and theorem proving, such as certified system software, concurrent separation logic, and Coq.

Now I actively working with Yizhou on a type system approach of faithful guide generation for amortized probabilistic inference (mostly for compiled sequential importance sampling).

Education
======
